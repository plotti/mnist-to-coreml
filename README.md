# How to go from MNIST to a full CoreML app on your iPhoneX
 
This is the accompanying code for the blog post https://www.liip.ch/en/blog/numbers-recognition-mnist-on-an-iphone-with-coreml-from-a-to-z. 

- In coreml_sample.ipynb you will find a Jupyter notebook showing you how to train a deep learning convolutional network with Keras and how to convert it to CoreML. 
- In the numbers folder you will find a XCode Project that has included the CoreML model.
- I've thrown in a number of example images to let you check if the model also works with real-life data.
